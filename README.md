## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Notice

CareSync is still under active development, and thus may not be stable for the end-user. Feel free to commit changes and fixes to improve our final product!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
As CareSync is still in its beta release, it is recommended to run it through VS Code. Clone the repository to your local computer and open this folder in VS Code. Then, open two terminal windows within VS Code. On one of the terminal windows, navigate to the **frontend** directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```
Now, run the following commands in each terminal to start the server and React frontend. If you are missing dependencies, open a new terminal window and install them accordingly.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now, you can nagivate to the localhost and port that the React project is running on in the browser of your choice and begin using the app!

## üí° Features
CareSync provides easy task management relating specifically to hospice care. Upon sign up, you can link your account to family members using their family number, which will sync your databases  and allow collaboration. Add tasks with assignees and due dates, or medications with specific dosage amounts, and view them in an organized layout on the dashboard page.
